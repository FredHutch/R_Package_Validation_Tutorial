# R Package Validation Tutorial

Welcome to the R Package Validation Tutorial!

Based on the R Package Validation Framework White Paper that is in preparation under PHUSE (citation), this tutorial aims to teach the basics of R package development while creating all the necessary documentation to support a validation. The training will show how to use the {valtools} package as part of the development process.

By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to apply the R Package Validation Framework to your internal R packages, and apply the {valtools} package.

## Schedule & Materials

The tutorial is planned to take about 4 hours, including breaks.

Slides and exercises are grouped by section. Exercises are split into `Spartan` or `Verbose`, indicating the amount of supplementary information provided. An answer key is also provided in the folder.

## Why take the the R Package Validation Tutorial?

This tutorial addresses a major knowledge gap in the R ecosystem: getting R accepted into highly regulated industries. This is an opportunity for those that work in these industries to be empowered to expand the use of R. We are taking an approach where some basic R knowledge is expected, such as writing scripts and functions, but teaching people to take the next steps.

Previous work presented to the community has shown a framework for developers to distribute validation-ready R packages, which has been met with enthusiasm among R users in pharma. In this tutorial participants will experience the process of creating R packages with validation resources in place and explore how addition of these materials perform in a variety of real-world scenarios, including validation-on-install and validation-post-install. Participants will have the opportunity to practice how validation affects subsequent package releases.

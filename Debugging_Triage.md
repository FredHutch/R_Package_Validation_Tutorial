## Debugging

When working through these slides and exercises, don't become discouraged if something does not work immediately or seems obtuse. Follow these instructions:

### Attendee

First, see if any of the other members of the breakout session are coming across similar difficulties. 

Optionally, see if you can reproduce the issue. 
Try re-starting the assignment and following the instructions. 
If you still come across errors, reach out to the TAs.

Alternatively, review the answer key and be focus on the discussion questions in the breakout group!
Be prepared to come back to the larger group discussion with answers.

### TA

TA will try to help with simple debugging.
If the solution is non-obvious, review the answer key.

Move onto the discussion questions and lead the breakout session with these topics. 

If any questions seem to be common, bring them to the organizers attention.

### Organizers

We will try to answer questions and resolve anything unclear/incorrect in the instructions. 

This may lead to an issue being opened on the repository with respect to a new discussion question or changes to existing instruction.

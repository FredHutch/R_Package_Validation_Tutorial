# Discussion: What are the different models of validation?
#    Already covered: 
#      - E01: validate outside of installed package aka "third-party validation"
#      - E02: validate from code aka "validate while developing"

# 

########### Task 04_E03 B
# validate on install
vt_validate_install()

########### Task 04_E03 C
# build a validated package to share
vt_validate_build()

########## Task 04_E03 D
# re-validate a package that has been installed
vt_validate_installed_package()


# Discussion: 
# 1. When do you see each mode being useful?
# 2. What documentation will be helpful to share with stakeholders?
